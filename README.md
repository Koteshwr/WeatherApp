React Weather App - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the React Weather App. The app allows users to search for a city name and retrieve weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Features

    Search for weather data by city name.
    Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition for the selected city.
    Clean and intuitive user interface.

Prerequisites

Before running the frontend of the React Weather App, ensure that you have the following installed:

    Node.js (v14 or above)
    npm (Node Package Manager)

Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend of the application:

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-weather-app-frontend.git
cd react-weather-app-frontend

    Install the required dependencies:

bash

npm install

    Start the React app:

bash

npm start

The React app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
API Endpoint Configuration

By default, the frontend app is configured to call the Django backend API at http://localhost:8000. If you deployed your backend API to AWS or any other server, you need to update the API endpoint in the frontend code.

Locate the API URL in the frontend code (typically in a service or utility file responsible for API calls) and replace it with the new endpoint.
Deployment

To deploy the frontend app to AWS or any other hosting service:

    Build the frontend app:

bash

npm run build

    Deploy the built files to your preferred hosting service. Ensure the backend API endpoint is properly configured to communicate with the deployed frontend.
